#read data from simulation and create new input file with the start position from where the simulation stopped last time

#specify input file to read:

folder = 'dynamic_rods_N10'

#read the input file in that folder, modify the clones file to start reading from

# modify also the remaining number of steps

#do not overwrite the old input_file (save all of them) to keep track of total number of steps?

#How to count the steps taken?

#Maybe it could also be good to be able to clean data
